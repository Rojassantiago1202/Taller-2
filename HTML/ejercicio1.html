    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

     <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<Strong>X</Strong>tensible <Strong>M</Strong>arkup <Strong>L</Strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <Strong>markup language</Strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <Strong>describe data</Strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. Y ou must <Strong>define your own tags</Strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <Strong>Document Type Definition</Strong> (DTD) or an <Strong>XML Schema</Strong> to describe <br>
            the data</li>
        <li>XML withaDTD or XML Schema is designed to be <Strong>self-descriptive</Strong></li>
</ul>

 <h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>

 <p><Strong>XML was designed to carry data.</Strong></p>

 <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML. <br>
        XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>

 <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. <br>
        HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>

 <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

 <h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>

 <p><Strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</Strong></p>

 <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created <br>
            to structure, store and to send information.</p>

 <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>

 <abbr title="<note>

    <to>Tove</t0>
    
    <from>Jani</Â£rom>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    
    <body>Don'r forget me this weekend!</body>
    </note>">Example:</abbr>

    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. <br>
        But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped <br>
        in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
